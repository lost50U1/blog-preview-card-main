## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about websites layout.

I used this css grid to make the content centered:

```css
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}

```


### Continued development

After this project i want to learn tailwind css and bootstrap and use them in the upcoming projects.


### Useful resources

- [Card component on freecode camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-basics-by-building-a-card-component/) - This helped me cause it got similar layout to some level.
